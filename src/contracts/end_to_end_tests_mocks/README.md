# INFORMATION

These mock contracts are only needed for end-to-end tests on Testnet:
Because zkLend is not deployed on Sepolia, using a mock is required in order to undertake end-to-end testings of the Tickets Handler contract.
(It does imply to also mock both the underlying asset of Tickets and the proof of deposit ERC20 contracts)
